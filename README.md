# chess
It's a chess game. It's crappy. Whatever.

controls
--------
The game will alternate between `player 1` and `player 2`.
You enter the starting and ending coordinates for each move (separated by spaces) and then press `ENTER`. 
the coordinates range from 1-8 on the X and Y axis, starting from the top left corner

a starting move of pawn to e4 would look like this:
```
player 1: 5 7 5 5
```
